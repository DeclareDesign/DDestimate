## Submission

Thank you for accepting this patch, which addresses the issue raised by Kurt that we had an unstated dependency on lfe. We removed the tests associated with lfe.

There are no changes to worse in reverse depends. 

We have checked this in win builder and on OS X, linux, and Windows in release, oldrel, and devel on Github Actions with no issues.
