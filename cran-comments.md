## Submission

We sincerely apologize for the delay in sending this update. This small patch mostly contains bugfixes, but also removes a dependency on `clubSandwich.` We now suggest the package and skip the test unless it is installed. We have also fixed small bugs due to the most recent version of clubSandwich posted yesterday.
